# FireSpy

FireSpy is an investigative networking tool designed to track and manage network activity on a Windows operating system.
The purpose of FireSpy will be to allow non-technical users a higher level of control over their networks, through visuals and useful information. FireSpy will track all data inbound and outbound and access as much information as possible, then provide a control point where the user can create firewall rules based on FireSpyâ€™s visual information (Such as blocking all outbound from a certain program).

The primary focus of this program will be gathering as much useful data as possible and displaying it all to the user in a range of graphs, then providing the user with simple functionality to deal with the data.

FireSpy will be developed using Visual Basic. I will be using Microsoft Forms to provide the front end, then Visual Basic to develop the backend.
